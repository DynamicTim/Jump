Add specific platformer body property object.
Contains Properties for:
	- Double Jump
	- Hang time
	- jump strength
	- wall jump
	- wall slide speed
	- variable jump window (longer button press equals higher jump)
	- grace period for being able to jump after walking off edge
	
	
Still to do for physics engine:
	- Add dynamic body collision DETECTION. I'm not worried about resolving those conflicts. Keep it simple. Just simple contact start/end type stuff.
	
Allow for selection of material. Render accordingly
