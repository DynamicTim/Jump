Add specific platformer body property object.
Contains Properties for:
	- Double Jump
	- Hang time
	- jump strength
	- wall jump
	- wall slide speed
	- variable jump window (longer button press equals higher jump)
	- grace period for being able to jump after walking off edge
	
	
Still to do for physics engine:
	Kinetic<->Dynamic Body Collisions
		- Jumping into the bottom of a kinetic body should end the jump (keep a 'bumped head' flag basically the opposite of 'grounded')
		- Crush mechanic doesn't look to be working correctly
			- When a moving platform (left or right) would crush the player against a wall. If the player runs into the platform, the 
			  collisions against the wall do not occur as expected.
