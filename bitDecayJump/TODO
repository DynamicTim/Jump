Fix bug where block slides off platform and loses x velocity as it hits the edge making it 'hug' the wall as it goes over the edge.

figure out if we can only check sides of blocks that our velocity could possibly hit
	- velocity.x > 0 means we can only hit left sides
	- velocity.x < 0 means we can only hit right sides
	- velocity.y > 0 means we can only hit bottom sides
	- velocity.y < 0 means we can only hit top sides
	
	- velocity.x == 0 ? Do we want to try to resolve left / right based on something else when this happens?
	- velocity.y == 0 ? Do we want to try to resolve up / down based on something else when this happens?
